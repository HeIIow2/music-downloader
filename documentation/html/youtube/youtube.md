# YouTube

I can get data from youtube with either calling:

- invidious
- youtube

I will only get the structured data from youtube music => `{artist} - Topic`. Maybe other stuff will be implemented

## Functionality

Every search results, where the channel name doesnt end with ` - Topic` will be ignored.

### ISRC search

### YT music

If searchin for artist, the query should be:  
`{artist} - Topic`
